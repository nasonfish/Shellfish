    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p>Tutorials started as a small idea by puffrfish, and grew into a larger functional site. We wanted to create our own service to benefit people in some way, and, while ideas get thrown out into the open really easily, this one seemed to stick with us.</p>
    <p>It started as a small "Display pages you add in an XML file" app, but eventaully, ideas piled up and we created our own system for storing the tutorials in a Redis database.</p>
    <p>The site quickly grew over a very small amount of time, with everything seeming to improve at the same time and the feel and functionality eventually getting better and better. We abandoned the default apache settings and started using Nginx configs, and we knew we were on to something</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Currently, the site is a fully functional tutorial organizer, manager, and searcher, and I'm really happy to have made it. I hope you can find use for it as well, and feel free to contribute suggestions if you have any!</p>
